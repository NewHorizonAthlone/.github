## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ New Horizon is a community group which has been working with international protection applicants in Athlone since 2000. Our main focus is on almost 350 residents in Direct Provision sites in Athlone and Horseleap, Moate. 
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
